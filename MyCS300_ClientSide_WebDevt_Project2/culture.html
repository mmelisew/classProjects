	<h3>Little Village</h3>

		Little Village is located next to the Little Italy, and we call it South Lawndale. This commercial district that anchors the Little Village neighborhood stretches an impressive two miles. In this area, you can find every kind of small business, such as ethnic groceries, souvenir stores, bakeries, candy shops, etc. If you are looking for a good Mexican food, you could come to the terra cotta Bienvenidos, a Little Village archway. In here, you will have the real taste of Mexican food just like you are in Mexico. You could take the taxi or Uber, or CTA 60 bus to go to Little Village.

	<h3>Little Italy</h3>
	<p>
		Little Italy, it’s now called university village, which is at the west side of Chicago. The community was once predominantly occupied by Italian immigrants. But now is made up of diverse ethnics and socio-economic backgrounds, as a result of immigration, urban renewal, gentrification and the growth of the resident student and faculty population of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Its Italian-American heritage is primarily evident in the Italian-American restaurants that once lined Taylor Street. There are many good restaurants in Little Italy, such as Al’s #1 Italian Beef, Chez Joel, County Barbeque, and Davanti Enotca. Those are the places you could try if you decide to travel around Little Italy neighborhood.
